\chapter*{Executive Summary}

{\bf A compulsory section, of at most $1$ page}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
This section should pr\'{e}cis the project context, aims and objectives,
and main contributions (e.g., deliverables) and achievements; the same
section may be called an abstract elsewhere.  The goal is to ensure the
reader is clear about what the topic is, what you have done within this
topic, {\em and} what your view of the outcome is.

The former aspects should be guided by your specification: essentially
this section is a (very) short version of what is typically the first
chapter.  Note that for research-type projects, this {\bf must} include
a clear research hypothesis.  This will obviously differ significantly
for each project, but an example might be as follows:

\begin{quote}
My research hypothesis is that a suitable genetic algorithm will yield
more accurate results (when applied to the standard ACME data set) than
the algorithm proposed by Jones and Smith, while also executing in less
time.
\end{quote}

\noindent
The latter aspects should (ideally) be presented as a concise, factual
bullet point list.  Again the points will differ for each project, but
an might be as follows:

\begin{quote}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
\item I spent $120$ hours collecting material on and learning about the
      Java garbage-collection sub-system.
\item I wrote a total of $5000$ lines of source code, comprising a Linux
      device driver for a robot (in C) and a GUI (in Java) that is
      used to control it.
\item I designed a new algorithm for computing the non-linear mapping
      from A-space to B-space using a genetic algorithm, see page $17$.
\item I implemented a version of the algorithm proposed by Jones and
      Smith in [6], see page $12$, corrected a mistake in it, and
      compared the results with several alternatives.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter*{Supporting Technologies}

{\bf A compulsory section, of at most $1$ page}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
This project has two parts - a back end engine written in Java, and a front end
visualisation part running in the browser using JavaScript.

\subsection*{Back End}
\begin{quote}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
    \item The Open Source routing engine GraphHopper~\cite{graphhopper} was
        used for performing basic routing requests and handling storage and
        processing of the OpenStreetMaps data.
    \item NanoHttpd~\cite{nanohttpd} was used for a static file server to
        provide HTML, CSS and images to the front end.
    \item Java WebSocket~\cite{javawebsocket} was used for communication
        between the front and back end.
    \item OpenStreetMaps~\cite{osm} is used for the raw mapping data. Specific sections of
        the maps can be downloaded from Geofabrik.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}

\subsection*{Front End}
\begin{quote}
\noindent
\begin{itemize}
    \item The map interface on the front end uses the JavaScript library
        Leaflet.js~\cite{leaflet} for the map and marker APIs.
    \item Mapbox is used for the image tiles to display the underlying map.
\end{itemize}
\end{quote}


% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter*{Notation and Acronyms}

{\bf An optional section, of roughly $1$ or $2$ pages}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
Any well written document will introduce notation and acronyms before
their use, {\em even if} they are standard in some way: this ensures
any reader can understand the resulting self-contained content.

Said introduction can exist within the dissertation itself, wherever
that is appropriate.  For an acronym, this is typically achieved at
the first point of use via ``Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)'' or
similar, noting the capitalisation of relevant letters.  However, it
can be useful to include an additional, dedicated list at the start
of the dissertation; the advantage of doing so is that you cannot
mistakenly use an acronym before defining it.  A limited example is
as follows:

\begin{quote}
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{lcl}
AES                 &:     & Advanced Encryption Standard                                         \\
DES                 &:     & Data Encryption Standard                                             \\
                    &\vdots&                                                                      \\
${\mathcal H}( x )$ &:     & the Hamming weight of $x$                                            \\
${\mathbb  F}_q$    &:     & a finite field with $q$ elements                                     \\
$x_i$               &:     & the $i$-th bit of some binary sequence $x$, st. $x_i \in \{ 0, 1 \}$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{quote}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

{\bf An optional section, of at most $1$ page}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
It is common practice (although totally optional) to acknowledge any
third-party advice, contribution or influence you have found useful
during your work.  Examples include support from friends or family,
the input of your Supervisor and/or Advisor, external organisations
or persons who  have supplied resources of some kind (e.g., funding,
advice or time), and so on.

% =============================================================================

% After the front matter comes a number of chapters; under each chapter,
% sections, subsections and even subsubsections are permissible.  The
% pages in this part are numbered with Arabic numerals.  Note that:
%
% - A reference point can be marked using \label{XXX}, and then later
%   referred to via \ref{XXX}; for example Chapter\ref{chap:context}.
% - The chapters are presented here in one file; this can become hard
%   to manage.  An alternative is to save the content in seprate files
%   the use \input{XXX} to import it, which acts like the #include
%   directive in C.

\chapter{Contextual Background}
\label{chap:context}

\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
When MapQuest first launched in 1996, most drivers found their way to new
locations using physical paper maps as well as knowledge gained through
experience. With the advent of Google Maps and the proliferation of mobile
devices, many drivers are now provided with directions that can incorporate
large amounts of additional information - including current traffic conditions
and road closures. This is particularly important in cities, where the levels of
congestion during `rush hour' can have a drastic impact on travel time.

Looking forwards, we can see two trends that suggest that congestion will become
more of an issue in future. Firstly, more and more people are living in cities -
even with good public transportation, this will increase the number of vehicles
on the road even if it lowers the proportion of households that own cars.
Secondly, on-demand transport solutions (such as those provided by Uber) are
leading to more vehicles on the road, especially at peak times. One of Uber's
key insights is using market techniques to better match supply and demand than
existing taxi and minicab services. If there is an increase in riders requesting
vehicles in a certain area, Uber activates \"surge pricing", increasing the cost
of the ride by a fixed multiple - for example, 1.5x. This information is sent to
their network of drivers, who will move to the location in search of higher
paying riders. The net result of this is that high-demand in certain areas will
create further congestion, even though on demand transportation is usually more
efficient than personal car ownership.

At the same time, we are beginning to witness the rise of self-driving cars,
capable of planning and executing routes themselves with no need for human
intervention. This raises many questions about the role of personal
transportation and the effect this will have on congestion. Will driving become
as dated as horseriding is today - or will people's enjoyment of it mean that
there'll always be human driven vehicles on the road? More importantly, will
self driving cars improve or harm congestion - and how will they decide what
routes they should take?
% could expand upon this with further extensions of long term self-driving
% future, as well as more specific issues that SDVs raise.

Answers to these questions are important to many people, including individual
drivers, companies owning large fleets of vehicles, and city planners. Although
it is not possible to provide definitive answers, simulation provides a
technique for evaluating how future transportation will look and the impact it
may have.

\textbf{original description bit\\}
This chapter should describe the project context, and motivate each of
the proposed aims and objectives.  Ideally, it is written at a fairly
high-level, and easily understood by a reader who is technically
competent but not an expert in the topic itself.

In short, the goal is to answer three questions for the reader.  First,
what is the project topic, or problem being investigated?  Second, why
is the topic important, or rather why should the reader care about it?
For example, why there is a need for this project (e.g., lack of similar
software or deficiency in existing software), who will benefit from the
project and in what way (e.g., end-users, or software developers) what
work does the project build on and why is the selected approach either
important and/or interesting (e.g., fills a gap in literature, applies
results from another field to a new problem).  Finally, what are the
central challenges involved and why are they significant?

The chapter should conclude with a concise bullet point list that
summarises the aims and objectives.  For example:

\begin{quote}
\noindent
The high-level objective of this project is to reduce the performance
gap between hardware and software implementations of modular arithmetic.
More specifically, the concrete aims are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Research and survey literature on public-key cryptography and
      identify the state of the art in exponentiation algorithms.
\item Improve the state of the art algorithm so that it can be used
      in an effective and flexible way on constrained devices.
\item Implement a framework for describing exponentiation algorithms
      and populate it with suitable examples from the literature on
      an ARM7 platform.
\item Use the framework to perform a study of algorithm performance
      in terms of time and space, and show the proposed improvements
      are worthwhile.
\end{enumerate}
\end{quote}

\chapter{Technical Background}
\label{chap:technical}

%\textbf{A compulsory chapter, of roughly $10$ pages}

\section{Algorithmic Background}

\subsection{Dijkstra's Algorithm}

Dijkstra's Algorithm~\cite{dijkstra}, originally designed in 1956, forms the
foundation of most modern routing algorithms.

The algorithm operates on a graph consisting of nodes connected to each other by
edges. Each edge has a weight - this could be the length of the road in a real
world map. Given two nodes $S$ and $D$, the goal is to return a list of edges that
represents the shortest path between the nodes.

At its core, the algorithm picks the edge with the next shortest distance
from the source node and updates the distance value for that node. It repeats
this process until it finds the source node connected to an edge, then works
backwards to construct the shortest path between the two nodes.

\textbf{Add more in depth english explanation of how/why it works k?}

\ref{dij-alg} shows how the algorithm operates in pseudocode.

\begin{algorithm}[t]
\SetKwProg{Fn}{Function}{}{}
\DontPrintSemicolon
\SetAlgoLined

    \Fn{\textsc{Dijkstra}(G,s,d)}{
        $Q \leftarrow \textrm{new Priority Queue}$ \;
        $dist[S] \leftarrow 0$ \;
        \For{vertex $v \in G$}{
            $dist[v] = \infty$ \;
            $prev[v] = undefined$ \;
            $Q.\textrm{add}(v, dist[v])$ \;
        }

        \While{$Q \neq \emptyset$}{
            $u \leftarrow Q.\textrm{extract\_min}()$ \;
            \If{$u = d$}{
                $\textbf{Return BuildPath(u)}$
            }
            \For{neighbour $v$ of $u$}{
                $d \leftarrow dist[u] + \textrm{distance}(u,v)$ \;
                \If{$d < dist[v]$}{
                    $dist[v] \leftarrow d$ \;
                    $prev[v] \leftarrow u$ \;
                    $Q.\textrm{decrease\_priority}(v, d)$ \;
                }
            }
        }
    }

\subsubsection{A* Algorithm}

\subsubsection{Contraction Heirarchies}

\subsection{Nagel-Schreckenberg Model}

The Nagel-Schreckenberg Model~\cite{nagel} is a cellular automaton model for the flow of
traffic on roads.

The model splits roads into discrete cells, with each car taking up a single
cell at a time. The vehicles then follow 4 rules, in parallel to simulate the
flow of traffic. Each car has a fixed 'velocity' $v$ for that step, which
represents the number of cells the vehicle will move forward in the final rule.
The model does not allow for overtaking, and as a result exhibits realistic
behaviour for traffic jams and flow.

Each cell is meant to approximately represent the size of vehicles

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Acceleration} - if the vehicle is not at the max speed and
        there is enough space ahead, increase the velocity by 1.
    \item \textbf{Slowing down} - if there is a vehicle nearer than the current
        velocity, reduce velocity to one cell less than the distance to the
        vehicle in front.
    \item \textbf{Randomization} - reduce the velocity by 1 with probability $p$
    \item \textbf{Car movement} -
\end{enumerate}

\section{Project Setup and Modularisation}

\section{Initial Client Server setup}

\section{Cell Automata Model}

\subsection{Vehicle and Cell Iterators}

\section{Performance Improvements}

\noindent
This chapter is intended to describe what you did: the goal is to explain
the main activity or activities, of any type, which constituted your work
during the project.  The content is highly topic-specific, but for many
projects it will make sense to split the chapter into two sections: one
will discuss the design of something (e.g., some hardware or software, or
an algorithm, or experiment), including any rationale or decisions made,
and the other will discuss how this design was realised via some form of
implementation.

This is, of course, far from ideal for {\em many} project topics.  Some
situations which clearly require a different approach include:

\begin{itemize}
\item In a project where asymptotic analysis of some algorithm is the goal,
      there is no real ``design and implementation'' in a traditional sense
      even though the activity of analysis is clearly within the remit of
      this chapter.
\item In a project where analysis of some results is as major, or a more
      major goal than the implementation that produced them, it might be
      sensible to merge this chapter with the next one: the main activity
      is such that discussion of the results cannot be viewed separately.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Note that it is common to include evidence of ``best practice'' project
management (e.g., use of version control, choice of programming language
and so on).  Rather than simply a rote list, make sure any such content
is useful and/or informative in some way: for example, if there was a
decision to be made then explain the trade-offs and implications
involved.

\chapter{Critical Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}

{\bf A topic-specific chapter, of roughly $15$ pages}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
This chapter is intended to evaluate what you did.  The content is highly
topic-specific, but for many projects will have flavours of the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item functional  testing, including analysis and explanation of failure
      cases,
\item behavioural testing, often including analysis of any results that
      draw some form of conclusion wrt. the aims and objectives,
      and
\item evaluation of options and decisions within the project, and/or a
      comparison with alternatives.
\end{enumerate}

\noindent
This chapter often acts to differentiate project quality: even if the work
completed is of a high technical quality, critical yet objective evaluation
and comparison of the outcomes is crucial.  In essence, the reader wants to
learn something, so the worst examples amount to simple statements of fact
(e.g., ``graph X shows the result is Y''); the best examples are analytical
and exploratory (e.g., ``graph X shows the result is Y, which means Z; this
contradicts [1], which may be because I use a different assumption'').  As
such, both positive {\em and} negative outcomes are valid {\em if} presented
in a suitable manner.

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{chap:conclusion}

{\bf A compulsory chapter,     of roughly $5$ pages}
\vspace{1cm}

\noindent
The concluding chapter of a dissertation is often underutilised because it
is too often left too close to the deadline: it is important to allocation
enough attention.  Ideally, the chapter will consist of three parts:

\begin{enumerate}
\item (Re)summarise the main contributions and achievements, in essence
      summing up the content.
\item Clearly state the current project status (e.g., ``X is working, Y
      is not'') and evaluate what has been achieved with respect to the
      initial aims and objectives (e.g., ``I completed aim X outlined
      previously, the evidence for this is within Chapter Y'').  There
      is no problem including aims which were not completed, but it is
      important to evaluate and/or justify why this is the case.
\item Outline any open problems or future plans.  Rather than treat this
      only as an exercise in what you {\em could} have done given more
      time, try to focus on any unexplored options or interesting outcomes
      (e.g., ``my experiment for X gave counter-intuitive results, this
      could be because Y and would form an interesting area for further
      study'' or ``users found feature Z of my software difficult to use,
      which is obvious in hindsight but not during at design stage; to
      resolve this, I could clearly apply the technique of Smith [7]'').
\end{enumerate}

% =============================================================================

% Finally, after the main matter, the back matter is specified.  This is
% typically populated with just the bibliography.  LaTeX deals with these
% in one of two ways, namely
%
% - inline, which roughly means the author specifies entries using the
%   \bibitem macro and typesets them manually, or
% - using BiBTeX, which means entries are contained in a separate file
%   (which is essentially a databased) then inported; this is the
%   approach used below, with the databased being dissertation.bib.
%
% Either way, the each entry has a key (or identifier) which can be used
% in the main matter to cite it, e.g., \cite{X}, \cite[Chapter 2}{Y}.

\backmatter

\bibliography{dissertation}

% -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

% The dissertation concludes with a set of (optional) appendicies; these are
% the same as chapters in a sense, but once signaled as being appendicies via
% the associated macro, LaTeX manages them appropriatly.

\appendix

\chapter{An Example Appendix}
\label{appx:example}

Content which is not central to, but may enhance the dissertation can be
included in one or more appendices; examples include, but are not limited
to

\begin{itemize}
\item lengthy mathematical proofs, numerical or graphical results which
      are summarised in the main body,
\item sample or example calculations,
      and
\item results of user studies or questionnaires.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Note that in line with most research conferences, the marking panel is not
obliged to read such appendices.
